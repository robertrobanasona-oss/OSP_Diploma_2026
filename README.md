## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Don't do this | ✅ Do this instead |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Upload an `.xlsx` file | Edit `students.csv` directly |
| Change the header row | Leave `NO,NAME,INDEX,DEPARTMENT` untouched |
| Edit someone else's row | Only add your own row at the bottom |
| Use lowercase names | Use UPPERCASE for full name |
| Add multiple rows | Add exactly ONE row |
| Commit directly to `main` | Always use a new branch + pull request |
